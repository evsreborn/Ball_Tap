To use: Drag and drop prefabs from Prefabs folder into scene and assemble to fit your needs.

Demo scene provided is partly linked to the DemoScene.fbx file rather than the CastlePack.fbx file, and is thus disconnected from the prefabs provided. However, every asset used in DemoScene.fbx come directly from CastlePack.fbx, and therefore can be recreated with the prefabs provided.

For intended results, switch from Gamma to Linear Color Space - (Edit > Project Settings > Player)
